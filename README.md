# CARGO Load Prediction
 I was involved in a data analytics project at QCRI, Qatar. As an intern my task were to preprocess airways cargo data, build regression model to predict receive cargo weight and to build classifier to infer whether a particular booking will show up or not. This involvement gave me enormous experience to deal with data pre-processing, feature extraction, model development, and evaluation.
