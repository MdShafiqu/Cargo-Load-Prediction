Implement deep learning in mobile device for real-time CFA image assessment. The developed deep learning model from objective-2 will be converted to a smaller but efficient version that can be implemented in mobile device. The outcome of this objective will be a mobile application that will allow users/doctors to capture images from CFA subjects and provide a normality score such as 1 (normal) - 7 (severe anomaly) about the camera fed images in real-time.
