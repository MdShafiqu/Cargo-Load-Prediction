 I was involved in a data analytics project at QCRI with Dr. Sanjay Chawlaâ€™s research group. As an intern my task were to preprocess Qatar Airways cargo data, build regression model to predict receive cargo weight and to build classifier to infer whether a particular booking will show up or not. This involvement gave me enormous experience to deal with data.
